Estimation of population size using the methods in
O. Frank & T.A.B. Snijders,
Estimating the size of hidden populations using snowball sampling,
Journal of Official Statistics, 10 (1994), 53 - 67.
Symbols used are as in this paper.

Current implementation: 
Vertex numbers of respondents and nominees must range between 1 and 1000.
Initial sample size maximum 400.
Out-degree maximum 40.
Larger implementation limits can be obtained by changing
the corresponding constants in the Turbo Pascal source code and recompiling.

Standard errors (j = jackknife, m = modelbased);
(modelbased standard errors usually are of doubtful practical value).
se_1    m                1.5
se_1    j                1.0
se_3    m                1.7
se_3    j                1.7
se_4    j                1.3
se_5    j                1.0

The conclusion section of Frank & Snijders (1994) favors estimates
v_3 and v_5, but notes that v_3 may be biased.
If v_3 and v_5 yield very different outcomes, v_3 is not reliable.
